<summary>Variables</summary>

<br/>

Variables can be declared as either a "var", "let" or "const". Using "let" and "const" is good modern practice. A "let" should be used for a variable whose value will change. A "const" (constant) should be used for variables that will not change in value.

<br/>

const variable examples
```sh
const cat = "Steve";
const age = 22;
const cost = 22.75;
 ```

<br/>

let variable examples
```sh
let cat = "Steve";
let age = 22;
let cost = 22.75;
 ```
