## Syntax

<details>
<summary>Comments</summary>

<br/>

Comments allow you to add notes to your code, without effecting the code itself.

```sh
// This is a single line comment
 ```
```sh
/*
This is a multi line comment
*/
 ```

<details>
<summary>Print</summary>

<br/>

Printing allows you to print messages to a console. Developers can use it for debugging.

```sh
console.log("cat");
 ```
```sh
console.log(45);
 ```
```sh
console.log(5 + 5); // Prints "10" to the console
 ```
```sh
console.log("5 + 5"); // Prints "5 + 5" to the console
 ```

<details>
<summary>Variables</summary>

<br/>

Variables can be declared as either a "var", "let" or "const". Using "let" and "const" is good modern practice. A "let" should be used for a variable whose value will change. A "const" (constant) should be used for variables that will not change in value.

<br/>

const variable examples
```sh
const cat = "Steve";
const age = 22;
const cost = 22.75;
 ```

<br/>

let variable examples
```sh
let cat = "Steve";
let age = 22;
let cost = 22.75;
 ```
